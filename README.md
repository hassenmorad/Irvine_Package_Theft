# Irvine Package Theft
Analysis of reported package thefts, as well as vehicle & garage burglary in Irvine, CA (2011-2019)

*I created an [interactive map](https://hassenmorad.github.io/irvine.html) that allows users to look for correlations & patterns between these different categories of petty theft

*This is the first iteration of this project, created with matplotlib (a time-lapse video of reported package theft plotted by month): https://youtu.be/a6sYRXIeFhY
