# Irvine Package Theft
Analysis of reported package thefts, as well as vehicle & garage burglary in Irvine, CA (2011-2019)

I created an [interactive map](https://hassenmorad.github.io/irvine.html) that allows users to look for correlations & patterns between these different categories of petty theft

*The first iteration of this project was a [time-lapse video](https://youtu.be/a6sYRXIeFhY). It was created from images of monthly package theft incidents plotted via matplotlib.
